			<p>There's just something about a sunset that can make you feel amazing, and sitting by the sea with a wonderful view of the sun going down is the perfect way to end the day for me. Cozumel offers some of the best sunsets in the world, and this was a big factor in my decision to come here. Apparently, psychologists say that a sunset can boost well-being, increase generosity and enhance life satisfaction, which certainly sounds accurate to me.</p>

			<p>The pictures above are a small sample of the sunsets in Cozumel.  As the pictures show, quite often the moodiest skies can make for the most beautiful sunsets. I live on the west side of the island, and within a 20 minute walk from the sea, where you get to see these amazing sunsets. The east side of the island is obviously where the sunrises, and it also has the best scenery and views on the island.  I've also included some pictures of the east side, because my website wouldn't feel complete without them.</p>
		
			<p>Like any other place in the world, there's a downside to living here, but I see it as a price to pay for living in paradise.  We're situated in the Caribbean Sea and very close to the Gulf of Mexico, which means we're in the pathway of a lot of tropical storms and sometimes hurricanes, particularly during the Summer and Autumn months. There have already been more than the normal amount of named storms this season, and it's only August.  As I'm writing this, we've been on a hurricane alert for 'Laura', but she seems to have bypassed us. Phew!  However, I always feel for the countries and people affected by any of the storms, and the devastation they cause.  2020 has been quite the year all round!  One positive thing about the storms is that the tempestuous skies can really enhance sunsets.</p>
