			<h2>About Me</h2>
      
			<p>My name is Lorraine and I made quite a difficult, but amazing decision to leave the UK and follow my heart in July 2018. I wasn't content in England, because I love the sun (which is seriously lacking in the UK), the sea and all things natural, so I knew that it wouldn't be my home forever.</p>

			<p>I've been living on a beautiful island in Mexico called Cozumel since I left England.  When I arrived I didn't have a job, but I had a qualification to teach English as a foreign language to students, and some savings to get by.  I soon found a platform on which I could teach English on a freelance basis, which kept me going with enough money to survive on here.  Since then I've discovered a new passion for web development, which is why I'm able to build this website.  This is my first project, and the main purpose of my site is to prove to myself and others that I'm capable of building a website from scratch with all my own code. However, it's also a type of blog that I hope will inspire anyone wanting to move to another country and reinvent themselves. I will go in to more detail regarding my studies, and building this site later. Click <a href="#studies">here</a> if you want to read more now.</p>

			<p>I consider myself to be naturally spiritual, and I like to practice mindfulness. I also recently learnt manifestation and meditation techniques, and as I'm writing this we're in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis, so I find a lot of comfort and peace in practicing them whenever I feel the need.  I'm grateful that my life hasn't been too heavily impacted, because I study and work from home anyway, however I obviously have concerns for my friends, family, and the whole world. It was very hard when I couldn't see my friends or socialise, but the restrictions are being lifted gradually here now, which feels great! I'm looking forward to the future, and very much to seeing my friends.  The reunion parties will definitely be something to remember. However, in the meantime, I will continue to focus on the things that I love about this island.</p>
			
			<h3>Why Cozumel?</h3>

			<p>I was familiar with the island from working on cruise ships many years ago, however my intention back in 2016, when I took my TEFL to teach English to foreign students, was to move to Thailand.  Thailand is an amazing country, and one in which I felt very comfortable and happy because of the people, safety and the food. Wow, the food!!! My decision changed after paying another visit to Cozumel in February 2018 when I really saw and appreciated the island for all it's beauty (instead of the inside of a bar or a beach club which were highlights as a crew member).  Life's been great since!!!</p>

			<p>As the name of my website depicts, one of my favourite things about this island are the amazing <a href="beautiful-sunsets.html">sunsets</a>, but the island is also famous for the pristine <a href="stunning-sea.html">sea</a>.  I've dedicated individual pages for both, which you can find by following the links, or by using the navigation buttons at the top right of the page.</p>

			<p>Another thing I enjoy immensely here are my morning walks by the sea.  This is the time I connect with nature the most, and I've never felt the euphoria from walking quite like I do here because I get lost in my music and the views.  At the present time, with the outbreak and lockdowns in place in most countries, I feel even more grateful to be here.  We have restrictions in place, but getting out for exercise is still allowed, and there's nothing like the views of the sea, the sun, fresh air, and wildlife to lift your spirits.  The people here are so friendly, but I've noticed their friendliness even more on my walks during this crazy time.  It feels like everyone is united, and people are extra happy to see human beings, albeit at a safe distance when passing them. </p>

			<p>I could go on for a long time about what I love about this island, but I don't want to bore you.  However, as music and dancing are also a big part of my life, I love the night scene here.  The island has far more to offer than the touristic places like Senor Frogs, Carlos'n Charlie's and Fat Tuesdays.  I often get to dance the night away with amazing views of the sea, jungle, sunset or the vibrant moon, and having some great friends here, including some that are DJs, makes it particularly special!</p>

      <h3 id="studies">Learning To Code</h3>

      <p>I've learnt the HTML5 and CSS languages, which are used for web design, as well as a little Javascript.  I decided to focus on the front end side of things for now, and reach a high level of expertise in this area before I delve too deep in to back end development, which would require me to learn other programming languages. I still have so much to learn, and one thing that I really love is that programming languages are constantly evolving so it will be my life long endeavour to keep up-to-date.  Initially, I used Udemy to learn the basics which was very beneficial, but I discovered Codecademy more recently and I got hooked because it's interactive, and I learn far more when I have the opportunity to practice. I would 100&#37 recommend both sites to anyone interested in learning to code or web development. However, if like me, you like to practice a lot and get tested on what you learn, then Codecademy would be a great fit!  They offer free subscriptions that enable you to learn a lot, but if you want to have full access to all the projects and tests, you can pay for a pro membership.  As a pro member you can choose to follow one or more of the many pathways which enable you to reach a specific goal, and they coninuously test you and give you projects to work on to make sure you fully understand what they've taught you. I love their style of teaching!</p>

			<h3>The Future</h3>

			<p>No-one knows for sure what the future holds, but I do know that Cozumel feels like home to me.  I have ambitious plans to become specialised in front end web development, and to have a successful career doing something that I love. My dream is to wake up every morning to a sea view, so once I have established myself enough as a web designer, I plan on moving from my very humble abode to a sea view apartment.  At that point I'll apply for residency here, but I'd still like to travel for 2 or 3 months a year during the rainy season.</p>

				<h4>Hummingbird</h4>
				<p>These are without a doubt my favorite creature on the planet.  I'm lucky enough to see them regularly on my balcony because they love the flowers on the shrub outside my window.  I have read many positive things about them, and what they symbolise, including: joy, peace, persistence, independence, resilience, luck, energy and love. All I know for sure is that I feel very happy when I see them, and I'm so grateful to have them visit me.</p> 
				<p><em>Random fact: Many species flap their wings between 50-80 beats per second, making them a blur to the human eye. But thatâ€™s actually slow for a hummingbird! When they dive, they can flap their wings up to 200 times per second.</em>
